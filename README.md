# Synology drive client for macOS minimalistic icons

The latest version 2.0.4-11112 of Synology Drive Client available at the release of macOS 11 aka Big Sur contains menu bar icons which are pretty bulky and are not in-line with macOS 11 minimalistic design.

These alternative icons try to be as close as possible to the macOS graphical design.
